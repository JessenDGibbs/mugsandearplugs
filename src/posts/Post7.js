      <b>game design:</b> the art of agency. game design is a delicate balance of creating systems 
      and mechanics that offer players certain degrees of freedom, certain constraints, and
       asking them to accomplish a goal within them. agency, and agents, have become a common 
       topic in the AI arena. the art of giving AI the ability to perform tasks, and have 
       agency, in systems beyond itself. orchestrating agents with different knowledge, objectives, and tools in order to complete
        a given task has been a large part of my work lately. while designing the system, and listening to 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_Two"> Ready Player Two, by Ernest Cline</a>, i've come to see how it's just game design without the fun gamer 
        vocab. i've also started looking at the job as a game design problem instead of 
        an AI problem and the it's 10x easier now. agents = characters, degrees of freedom = 
        tools, and constraints = rules, context, and role. but game characters on their 
        own don't drive the storyline forward. events, dialog, and missions do. in the AI 
        application of this framework this manifests as steps, feedback, and sub-tasks. 
        the way i govern it all is with an orchestration agent, or 'director'. i've previously
         explored game design and found the parallels between game mechanics and reality
          mechanics super exciting. we are subject to some constraints (e.g. time) and given
           certain degrees of freedom (e.g. we can walk). the 'winning' criteria of life
            seem impossible to discover, however i recently read this: "to win this game
             you just have to try to make the experience of being forced to play as pleasant
              as possible for yourself and everyone else around you." taken from Ready 
             Player Two. one of the fundamental rules of game design is that it must be 
             optional to play. so we got dealt a bad game to spawn into. game design seems
              to be in play in any system with entities that have agency, which is why it
               makes sense that game design thinking makes building AI systems so much easier.
                agent systems are exactly the material that game design is the art of. 
                the novel part is that in this game the characters can engage in conversations
                 and dialog that we don't have to be part of. the story can progress without 
                 the player or game designer building, or playing the game. my director can
                  engage with the lead researcher and narrative architect, provide feedback, 
                  and iterate through work without me being part of the system. i set up the
                   game, and then let it play. sometimes they suck at playing the game and 
                   i end up getting shitty results anyways, but it's still a more efficient 
                   and cost-effective system than working with a group of interns. yikes.
