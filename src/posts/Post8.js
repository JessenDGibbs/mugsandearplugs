        <b>digital boxes</b>: the cyclical nature of things will present itself in 
        frustrating ways sometimes. this is the idea that the same things we had in the 
        past will surface at some point in the future, but in a slightly different 
        form/context. we all bought Netflix to get away from the ads and centralized 
        programming of television. then, as competition in the space grew, we only 
        ended up getting away from the scheduling and are subject to ads again. 
        Amazon Prime is the worst for this. they drop good old TV style ads right 
        in the middle of your show now. but as more content providers start to own 
        the rights to different shows, we find ourselves collecting subscriptions to 
        a variety of platforms so that we can have access to everything we want. 
        reminiscent of when we had to pay for certain channels on TV, no? the same 
        type of cycles happen all over the place if you look closely. one of the 
        funnier ones someone pointed out to me was going from cave drawings to emojis. 
        we drew on cave walls, learned to articulate the ideas, built a beautiful 
        language system that launched our species ahead, and now we post emojis on 
        all of our digital walls. the cycle i wanted to write this post about is boxed 
        software. when Microsoft launched its early software customers would have to 
        go to a store, buy a box that contained the downloadable software, and then go 
        home and install it. following that, cloud services grew and now we can all just 
        stream our software from big providers without leaving our homes. but i foresee 
        boxes in our future. they won't be cardboard or in a store, but they'll be 
        standalone packages that we download into our local machine and can run without 
        any external systems. fully local, fully ours. we will have ownership over our
        personal internet. ownership of digital content has 
        become murky. we pay for access to the tools and apps we love but rarely do we 
        ever truly own them. the distinction between ownership, possession, and control 
        is notable here. you can own something without possessing it or have any control 
        over it. for example, you can buy stock in a company (ownership), but you don't 
        possess or control it. you can also have possession and control of something without 
        having any ownership. for example, you can have possession and control of an 
        electric bike without owning it if the bike is provided from a subscription 
        service. in most cases, you'll find that you'll have possession of your digital 
        tools, if you're lucky, or you won't even have that and you'll only have access 
        to it. centralizing digital goods makes it way easier for all of us to access 
        them, but at the cost of ownership. in the future, where boxes come back in 
        style, i'm expecting to see some really interesting personalized internet configs. 
        it'll be like building your characters for an RPG game. we'll each build and 
        evolve our internet configs based on what our missions are and only go online 
        to get new gear when we need it, or to step into the underworld of internet social 
        media. i believe this shift will be dominantly lead by the normalization of people
        having digital selves (AI brains that mimic how they percieve, think, and act) that they
        won't trust centralized services to manage.
