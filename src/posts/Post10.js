          <b>top {'->'} down:</b> we should teach top-level, up-to-date knowledge before the fundamentals. the most recent knowledge produced at the research level has immediate and intutive context in life. by first bringing the leading research down to the grade 1 level we can invite students to continue learning in order to understand 'why' it is so. besides the fact that teaching children the fundementals first creates reason to engage with future education to contexualize out of context concepts and the role they play in life, it doesn't make much sense to me. let's keep kids, and early education, up to date with the latest research, and move fundemental understanding into higher education, prompting curiosity, and ensuring that everything tought is immediately valuable to the student's life.
