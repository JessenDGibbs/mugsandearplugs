      <b>Amidst war, localize the internet: </b>Destroying the internet would be a strong play amidst a global war. 
      It would level the playing field. Data centers and networks would become focal points for attacks in an effort to 
      slow communication and divide players. Domestic unrest would lead to internal instability 
      of global super-powers and weaken their frontline efforts. Smaller players would 
      benefit. Localizing the internet, and controlling mass information access would be 
      one way to resist this risk. As the global internet falls, individuals should seek 
      to take as much information as possible into their own, local, secure, and self-managed 
      systems. As  global architectures and netwoks become more risky local internets and 
      information management will boom. SImilarly accessible hardware than can run it will 
      also boom.
