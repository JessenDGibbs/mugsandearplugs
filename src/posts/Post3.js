        <b>anime and company building</b>: I like to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">the hero's journey</a> as model of success for anything with agency that takes action. Strong protagonists often start weak. It makes them relatable to the audience and gives them some reason to fight, grow, awaken. Starting off weak creates a 'nobody' narrative in their world. The 'nobody' narrative can be external, internal, or both, but it must be there for the hero's journey to work. The narrative is often in relation to some goal. 'I am nobody until I do X' or 'they are nobody compared to Y'. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba">Demon Slayer</a>, Tanjiro sees himself as a regular kid. He would be happy to work the land at home, but his sister was bitten by a demon and became one herself. Everyone else he runs into sees Tanjiro in the same light. He's subject to both the internal and external 'nobody narratives'. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>, Aang only sees himself as a kid. He wants to play with his friends, enjoy life, and doesn't care to be the Avatar. But despite the internal 'nobody' narrative, the entire world is hunting for him either to kill him or to be saved. Sung Jin-woo, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_Leveling">Solo Leveling</a>, is seen and measured as the weakest Hunter with the lowest rank. He and everyone else around him know he's a 'nobody'. Regardless of where the 'nobody' narrative comes from, the outcome is the same. The hero must go through an intensive period of training, proving, and awakening before their name means anything. The training process is valuable because the hero gets to hone capabilities, expose character traits, and refine the purpose of the whole story. This is consistently where I either connect with the protagonist or stop watching the show. Protagonists and companies follow similar paths to success. <b> capabilities.</b> What can you do? If a name is to be known and respected, the entity it represents must do something that people respect. When a young hero is introduced, their capabilities are demonstrated during their training period. Learning, failing, and eventually getting stronger, we follow a clear arc that shows us their potential. When a young company is introduced, it should also focus on showing their audience their training, failures, reflections, and lessons, so that their potential and capabilities can come to the surface. The most tangible way to do this is through demos. Even if the demo isn't perfectly in line with your main story - just how cutting a boulder in half wasn't exactly part of Tanjiro's mission to free his demon-infected sister - it's a great opportunity to demonstrate your capabilities and expose your character traits. High-effort side quests let the audience know how committed you are and are always where your true character comes out. <b>purpose.</b> Why are you honing your capabilities? A hero who just wants to be a hero can be off-putting and hard to relate to. There needs to be something beyond the hero that is driving them to level up and go through all the hard work to make it happen. Generally, the heroes who act in service of something completely other than themselves are the most loved. They suffer in service of the thing they love. <b>characteristics.</b> How do you wield your purpose and capabilities? Characteristics are the difference between a hero, villain, and nobody. Any set of people can have the same capabilities and purpose. Nobodies can be really powerful, but they don't do anything about it, so no one cares. Villains can have an honorable mission, but they often destroy everything along the path to get there. Heroes are the only ones who serve a clear purpose while also tending the balance of things as they pursue it. Being a hero is the hardest. You have to do more and be better than everyone else. When crafting a character or building a company, assume that the name means nothing. Because it doesn't. Train hard and show people how hard you are training. Fight battles, make demos, and respect the value of high-effort side quests. Prove your capabilities by taking on challenges that others are into. Help others along the way.
