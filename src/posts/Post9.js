      <b>atomized content and centralised consumption balances</b>: following on
      from a previous post about digital boxes, i think the same can be said for
      consuming content. between major news sources, particularly in
      media-centric countries like the UK, we're spending far more than is
      optimal to remain informed about the world. what do i mean by optimal?
      there are plenty of articles in the NYT that i would be willing to pay $1
      for. that said, the litany of articles i am not willing to pay for
      prevents me from justifying the monthly price. the same can be said across
      media and content platforms. i would pay for to watch the bodyguard, or
      breaking bad etc, but i don't want to pay for an entire subscription to
      Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, Hulu, and HBO. this applies to essentially
      any thoughtfully produced, paywalled content. i thus propose that we
      atomize consumable media to optimise our spending and increase the
      public's engagement with Good Things. how can this be done when content is
      so fragmented across producers and modalities? this is kind of a
      non-problem, as most content is centralised on social media - some of
      which (like Twitter), are essentially glorified link-sharing platforms.
      hence, i imagine a world where i top up my Twitter balance, and this
      grants me access, on an article-by-article basis, to what i want to read.
      the most in-demand interview of the day may sell for $3, while the
      standard Atlantic piece may sell for $0.50 - but either way, i am able to
      match my spending (my observed behaviour), with my preferences. this is a
      win-win for the consumer and the producer. the consumer gets to read what
      they want, and the producer gets paid for what they produce. this being
      said, the platforms must adapt to this new model, likely at a (temporary)
      net loss, so it may reqruire some kind of induced social movement against
      subscriptions to make this happen.
