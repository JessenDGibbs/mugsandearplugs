      <b>Blank Pages and Unprompted Action:</b> one of the things on my mind
      recently has been whether the quality of our work is dependent on how
      creative (how new) it is, or whether it depends more on the execution. i
      think it's fairly self evident that creative work is harder. there are a
      infinite ideas out there, so to land on one that fits with the
      external world in the right way, such that it's useful, is a low probaiblity
      event. its therefore natural that we might conclude that creative acts are more
      valuable/impressive. but i also think that creativity as a divergence from
      a point (the present) into a new set of points which can then be iterated
      on (unprecedented Stuff), is the wrong way of looking at it. that implies
      that anything beyond the point "now" is complete creativity - that it's new,
      and unseen and unpredicted. but it's not - it's also the product of the
      conversations and thoughts and experiences that came before it. instead of
      thinking of something new from nothing, we combine what we have in a new
      way. we we're prompted - nothing came from a truly blank page. give
      someone a blank page, and tell them of the freedom this gives them - that
      they can take this and build something unprecedented. they'll freeze up.
      they'll shy away from it. why? because there's nothing to improve or
      challenge or attack or defend. put it this way: we've all had great ideas
      come from conversation. but this is because a conversation is a tennis
      match of good and bad ideas - bounded by rules, or a goal, or some other
      reason for having it - even if that's pure curiosity. the best ideas we're
      prompted, not spawned - whether these are ideas about ourselves or about
      something new. we're already used to prompting AI, and we dread the day it
      acts without such a prompt. in this domain, the quality of the prompt
      largely determines the quality of the response. the same appears to be
      true for humans, so why is a blank page still considered the most iconic /
      effective prompt for something new? even figuratively ("this semester is a
      blank page for me"). so, i'd like to get rid of the idea that we can - or
      should - create from nothing, and instead focus on the idea that we can
      create from anything. that's the real challenge.{" "}
